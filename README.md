<br/>

*Because I know the pain of using Audio editing software just to apply nightcore edits to audio files, I have made this for you.* <br/>

<br/>

**Features :** <br/>
* An easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br/>

* All what you have to do is just choosing the speed change percentage and the program will change the `pitch` and `tempo` automatically for you. <br/>


* Works prefectly without Python installed. <br/>


* Free and Open-Source! <br/>


* Allows you to publish the edits you make anywhere without any restrictions. <br/>

* It doesn't need a documentation as it is much easier to use than all audio editing software. <br/>


* It exports the result as a `wav` file, which is supported by all devices and software. <br/>

* It allows for changing the output result quality rate, Which allows for better size management. <br/>

* It also has an great looking Graphical User Interface (GUI)! <br/>


<br/>


## How to use? <br/>


*The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of this program is divided into 3 layers*, each of them plays an important role in the **GUI** <br/>


**The first Layer :** <br/>


It contains a lot of informative labels (these labels above the other widgets) and they are used to help you know what does each widget do, and what should you to apply a successful nightcore edit. <br/>


**The second Layer :** <br/>


It contains the widgets of the User Interface (GUI), It allows you to customize the commands you are sending to the module which allows for better customization. <br/>


**The third and the last Layer :** <br/>


It contains the most important button in the program, and it is the **"Nightcore it!"** button, and I think you already know what it does. <br/>


<br/>


## Documentation? <br/>


*If you need a documentation for the program*, Help this program reach at least **2K** (2000) Downloads or more, and I will try to do my best to make a great documentation file for this program. <br/>


## The idea of this program <br/>


I came up with the idea of it when I wanted to start a nightcore channel, I asked myself, Isn't nightcoring songs just changing it's speed and the `Pitch` and so on the `Tempo` of the song? <br/>


Then, I made this firstly for myself, assuming I would start a nightcore channel, Then after a lot of thinking, I finally decided to make this available for everyone to download freely, to help them nightcore songs without the pain of using Audio editing software. <br/>


## Limitations <br/>


There is only 1 limit to this program (Which can sometimes be considered annoying for some people), it is that you must have your song as a `wav` file, also, the output will be a `wav` file, it is not really that annoying because the `wav` audio format can be played on anything, and it can be opened by all video editing software. <br/>
